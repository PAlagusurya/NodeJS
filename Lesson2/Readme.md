## JavaScript Engine Evolution: From Frontend to Backend

1. **Different Browsers, Different Engines**:  
   Different web browsers use different engines to convert JavaScript into machine-understandable code. For example, Google Chrome uses the V8 engine, Firefox uses SpiderMonkey, and Safari uses JavaScriptCore.

2. **ECMAScript Standard**:  
   To ensure consistency across different engines and browsers, JavaScript follows the ECMAScript standard, maintained by the TC39 committee. This standard defines the core features and behavior of the language, making JavaScript predictable and consistent.

3. **V8 Engine in Browsers**:  
   The V8 engine, used by Google Chrome, is responsible for reading and executing JavaScript code in the browser. It compiles JavaScript into machine code using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, making it fast and efficient for frontend tasks like handling user interactions, DOM manipulations, and rendering.

4. **Node.js for Backend**:  
   JavaScript, traditionally used only for frontend development, was extended to the server-side with the introduction of **Node.js**. Node.js embeds the V8 engine to process JavaScript on the server, enabling JavaScript to handle server tasks like API calls, database connections, and file I/O.

5. **Extended Server-Side Capabilities**:  
   In addition to embedding V8, Node.js provides additional features like event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O to enable JavaScript to function as a powerful server-side language, handling backend tasks similar to other server languages (e.g., Python, Java, Ruby,Go).
