# Node.js Threading Model

Node.js is primarily **single-threaded** for executing JavaScript code but can be considered **multithreaded** for handling certain types of operations. Here's an explanation of how Node.js handles different tasks:

## 1. **Single-Threaded JavaScript Execution**

- **Node.js** executes JavaScript code on a **single thread** using the **event loop**.
- This means only one piece of JavaScript code is executed at a time, making Node.js single-threaded for **JavaScript execution**.

## 2. **Asynchronous Tasks Offloaded to libuv**

- When Node.js encounters **asynchronous tasks** (e.g., file I/O, network requests, DNS lookups), it **offloads** these tasks to **libuv**, a C library that Node.js uses to handle asynchronous operations.
- **libuv** uses the underlying **OS methods** (like `epoll`, `kqueue`, or IOCP) to execute these asynchronous tasks **without blocking** the main thread.
  - **Non-blocking I/O operations** (e.g., reading files, making network requests) are handled by libuv, which executes them in the background and notifies Node.js when the task is complete.

## 3. **Handling Heavy or Blocking Operations (Thread Pool)**

- For **CPU-heavy or blocking operations** (e.g., file system operations, cryptographic tasks, etc.), Node.js uses a **thread pool** within libuv.
- By default, the **thread pool size** is set to **4** (`UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=4`), and it can be adjusted as per requirements.
- When Node.js needs to execute these tasks, they are offloaded to the thread pool. Once the task is completed, the result is passed to the **callback function**.

## 4. **Event Loop and Callback Execution**

- The **event loop** continuously checks if there are any tasks in the **call stack**.
- When the **call stack is empty**, the event loop checks if there are any tasks in the **callback queue**.
- If there are tasks in the callback queue (such as the completion of asynchronous tasks), the event loop pushes them to the call stack for execution.

## 5. **Summary**

- **Node.js is single-threaded** for running JavaScript code via the event loop.
- Asynchronous tasks are offloaded to **libuv**, which uses underlying OS methods to execute them without blocking the main thread.
- For **CPU-heavy or blocking operations**, Node.js uses a **thread pool** (default size of 4) to handle these tasks in parallel.
- Once the task is done, the result is pushed to the **callback queue**, and the event loop processes it when the call stack is empty.
